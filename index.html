    <h1>Interactive Design Assignment 1</h1>

    <h2><em>Fractal Fantasy</em></h2>

    <h3>What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the experience? </h3>

    <p>The liquidity of the website and how each motion from my mouse produces an interesting ripple effect. Coupled with the metallic effect, it really captures my <em> full attention</em></p>

    <h3>Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of your discrete actions.</h3>

    <p><ul>
      <li>Playing with the liquid effect to create some interesting ripple effects</li>
      <li>Going through all the different tabs and see which really caught my eye</li>
      <li>In the the tour tab, I try to first lightly hover my cursor above the literal web and then try to cut the literal web and make precise incesions to cut all but one string where the gravity of the weight of the dangling web would snap the string entirely </li></p>

    <h3>What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging with?</h3>

    <p>As I have quite an interest in water and liquid form, I tend to focus on the tabs that focus on anything to do with water. As such, I gravitated twoards tabs in "liquid entropy, first opus, and unction". As I spend more time, I felt as though I am lost in the complex interplay of molecules within a metallic fluid. There is this enigmatic pattern that feels orderly and yet disorderly at the same time in a delicate balance that intrigues me</p>
    
    <h3>What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with the experience??</h3>

    <p>I tend to just get lost in moving my cursor over and over for around 10 minutes. Gazing on the dance of harmony and discord in an admittedly pretentious manner </p>

    <h3>What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive experience?</h3>

    <p>I believe the goal for fractal fantasy is an artistic mathematical experience that is an interplay between order and discord. Although seemingly chaotic, the mathematical formula used can convey order in the same vein as reality with hidden symmetries and paterns that converge into an orderly form similar to branches of trees </p>

    <h3>How does the interactive experience communicate this primary goal?</h3>

    <p>From what I understand, all the mechanics require a substantial amount of mathematical computations in order to function. It encapsulates the beauty of the fusion between math and art as something immersively cohecive.</p>

    <h3>What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted with over time? (For how long and how many different times)</h3>

    <p>I believe the website is quite timeless in its interactivity. Perhaps if the technology progressed significantly in the future, it could mean that the interactivity could be translated to AR just from the web </p>

    <h3>How does the interactive experience communicate how it should be interacted with over time?</h3>

    <p>The first time I visited the site, there was a sense of awe and an almost euphoric sense of satisfaction. I tinkered quite substantially with the different tabs within the first few minutes. However, as I progress, the "magic" eventualy died down once I got the gist of what everything is on offer. However, I would return to the website as a sort of "hey come look at this" to my mates for that wow factor </p>

    <h3>What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience reference?</h3>

    <p>This weirdly reminds me of the water physics found in the latest Animal Crossing game. The water physics in that game is probably the most advanced </p>

    <h3>What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should act when engaging with your research experience?</h3>

    <p>When you are walking on a puddle, it would have that water rippling effect. When swimming, each movement coincides with water ripples of flowing water depicted quite accurately to real life water</p>

    <h3>What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should feel when engaging with your research experience?</h3>

    <p>Each time I swim in the game, it makes me feel as though I swim in real life and in a way it makes me feel cozy and relaxed. This is due in part, from my experience as an avid swimmer. On another note, it does make me feel thirsty with any interaction with water in the game for some reason.</p>

    <h3>What is the most frustrating part of the interaction to you and what makes that part frustrating?</h3>

    <p>Some of the tabs were less than satisfying such as the virtua tab, which took quite sometime to load and it did buffer quite a lot so it was quite frustrating to finish.</p>

    <h3>What is the most satisfying part of the interaction to you and what makes that part satisfying?</h3>

    <p>As said previously, the metallic liquid look has this mesmerising look to it in a way that it simulates water ripples. The reason as to why I find it satisfying is because anything to do water simulation and movement has always been mesmerising to me and I appreciate the application of water movement in any sort of digital media. </p>
